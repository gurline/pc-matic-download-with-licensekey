License keys can be retrieved from multiple sources including your original purchase confirmation email, account dashboard within the PC Matic portal, or through customer support channels if you have misplaced your activation credentials. Understanding your specific license type and its associated limitations helps ensure you download the appropriate software version and configure settings that align with your protection requirements.

Preparing Your System for Download
----------------------------------

Before initiating the PC Matic download process, conduct a comprehensive assessment of your system specifications to ensure compatibility with the software requirements.
